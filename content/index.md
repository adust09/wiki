Hi and welcome!
This is a space for Shouki to share his notes and ideas.
I am interested in blockchain, crypto theory, and privacy.

If you are interested in my past articles and efforts, please feel free to take a look. Comments are also welcome.
I like to discuss and work together with various people on projects. Please feel free to contact me if we have anything in common.

## Selected blog posts

## Projects

Compilations of various projects that have shaped the technologist I currently am. It's a mix of applied research, e2e products, and academic work.
